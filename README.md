# Caremmunity (Hackatown 2018)

**Caremmunity** is our submission to this year's Hackatown.
It is a platform to exchange services between citizens, to give and receive endlessly and kindly.
One can request specific services and others may apply for the job.
Once an applicant has been chosen, he/she can complete the job, and earn *carepoints*.
You can also recommend someone's skills and help build a strong community of helping and caring.
